Blog posts about electric generation and manufacturing

I read a really cool blurb and something you should do when you want to learn about a new topic. The technique is as follows:

Pick a narrow topic and write a weekly newsletter about it for three months. It will force you to consolidate your thoughts and will show you that even narrow topics are infinitely deep. And limiting it to three months means youâ€™ll probably do it. Call it: Season One.

So I am using GitHub to track my electricity generation and manufacturing research and blog posts about it.
